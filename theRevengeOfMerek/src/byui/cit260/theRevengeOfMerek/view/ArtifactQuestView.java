/*This quest will be given to you from the Lord of each county.  A bandit has recently stolen a priceless
*artifact and to prove your loyalty to the county, you need to retrieve this item.  It will involve going to 
*the city mentioned in the question in which you will encounter the bandit.  The Battle Menu will then be 
*initialized and if you defeat the bandit, you will acquire the artifact.  This will complete the quest and 
gain more of the Lordâ€™s trust.
